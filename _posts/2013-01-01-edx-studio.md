lead:       "Helping edX grow its catalog exponentially by expediting online course authoring"
introduction: "As edX continues to grow, so do the products and teams that support its mission of expanding education to more people across the globe. To sustain UX and Front-end support across this growth, we created a cross-organization set of UI and front-end patterns. These patterns are meant to maintain a quality experience for edX's users, enpower engineers with less Front End experience, and keep the edX product and brand consistent. For the past 6 months, I've spearheaded this effort by leading a team of designers and developers through the project's backlog."
